This is the beginnings of a Machine Learning library for use at CERN. Currently, the only solidified plans in place are implementations of K-NN, Artificial Neural Networks (with stacked Autoencoders), logistic regression (as a baseline comparison method), and then finally the implementation of a more experimental method: Spiking Neural Networks (also with stacked autoencoders, but that needs to be further explored.
